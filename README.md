# SwiftUI Firebase Authentication App

This is a simple iOS application built using **SwiftUI** and **Firebase Authentication**. The app allows users to **sign up**, **log in**, and **log out** using their email and password. It demonstrates the use of `FirebaseAuth`, `ObservableObject` for state management, and basic navigation using `NavigationStack`.
